            "The film commences with a portrait of society's caste divide, with the police checking the caste of detainees to determine who should be released. Only inmates from the upper and middle castes get released. The police blame people from lower caste accusing them of perpetrating crimes in multiple pending cases.[6] Rajakannu and Sengeni are a couple from the Irula tribe who labour in the fields of upper-caste men to control rat infestation and catch venomous snakes. Rajakannu is called to a rich man's dwelling to catch a snake that sneaked inside a room. The next day, a case of burglary is reported when the wife of the man reports missing jewellery pieces from her closet and raises doubt on Rajakannu. The police invade Rajakannu's home to find evidence. Rajakannu had left the town earlier for work. During the invasion, the police brutally beat and unlawfully detains his pregnant wife. The police arrest other relatives, Rajakannu's brother, Iruttupan, his sister Pachaiammal and his brother-in-law, Mosukutty and torture them to confess the whereabouts of Rajakannu. The police find Rajakannu and imprison him. They brutally torture him to confess the crime but releases his wife. Later, Sengeni is informed that all three men in detention are absconding and police threaten her furthermore to tell them about their whereabouts.",
